                    Inspired by visionaries like Blessed Basil Moreau, C.S.C., who grounded a Holy Cross education in the formation of the whole person through the concurrent development of the mind and heart, residential life is one of the most distinctive features of a Notre Dame undergraduate experience and unlike any other in American higher education.
                    At Notre Dame, residential life is designed to form undergraduate communities that are inclusive of all members; dedicated to the intellectual, moral, and spiritual development of each individual; and characterized by a collective sense of care and concern for the common good and service to others. 
                    Residential Life also offers several housing options to graduate students to assist in sustaining their quality of life outside the classroom and to summer guests to aid in their visit to campus.
